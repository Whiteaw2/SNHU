CS210: Module Eight

Q: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
A: In this project, Project Three from Module Eight, we were tasked with combining Python and C++ to create a program which leveraged the strengths of both languages to read, quantify, and display inventory for a grocer.

Q: What did you do particularly well?
A: In this project, I demonstrated understanding of data types, file streams, input validation, and custom function creation as well as troubleshooting.

Q: Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
A: There are a few tasks which are repeated, and would benefit from being merged into one technique. Though they were done strategically to demonstrate understanding in this instance, this is certainly an area in which improvements could be made.

Q: Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
A: The portions of the code which read file streams and the sections of the code that dealt with pointers were the most challenging. I have found several resources that I can visit again, online forums and documentation where detailed help can be found - these will be extremely helpful moving forward.

Q: What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
A: Without question, the ability to read and write to files will be invaluable in my work from here on out. I have done it before, but knowing how it works will enable me to customize the code and deal with unforseen issues in ways that I was unable to earlier.

Q: How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
A: Besides basic comments, this program contains menu functions and others (including base integrations between and Python) which will be leveraged and adapted later.
